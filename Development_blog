Keyword extraction for short physics letters, using TFIDF. Extractive summarization will use Textrank and Abstractive summarization will use a pre-trained model and further apply to QA chatbot 28/09/23
The task changed, so this project will apply NLTK to split sentences and words to achieve better results. Networkx package is used for textrank since self-written textrank.py has an issue returning an empty list. 28/09/23
using nltk now, in order to use IDA and further with (bert)BiLSTM-CRF for sequence labeling and NER. QA chatbot now is taking data for prediction from my other project cWgan-gp for inverse design and is able to plot results via event. 27/09/23
This is the practice section for keyword extraction for English and Chinese (end) data.txt is from my paper, and idf.txt was trained using data.txt (end) Using Own sentencesplitter.py to split sentences, still has some flaws, can use nltk or jiebe to improve, but not in this work. 21/09/23 (end)

Development blog:
added text summarization Maximal Marginal Relevance(MMR) 28/09/23

Texkrank summarization is uploaded and useable for extracting BBC news dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pariza/bbc-news-summary. self-written textrank.py works for Chinese, not sure why in English it returns an empty list, will continue investigating. Word_embedding is used glove.6b.50d.txt.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/glove6b50d (28/09/23) image

Seems that nltk separates few flaws, but still able to extract 4 important words. 27/09/23 (end, problem solved for M, caused by not lower() the content) image

Stil error in textrank. added simple partofspeech pos_tagging.py. TFIDF can extract the correct keywords in a length of 6. The result below is the keywords extracted from my paper. 22/09/23 image

Problem with textrank, I don't know why show ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence, and why pass empty to min and max, didn't pass the unitest. (Yet TFIDF is working perfectly. Will add LDA later on ) 21/09/23
